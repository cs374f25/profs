## About MWM

**[madiSTEM](https://www.jmu.edu/mathstat/madistem/)** is an annual outreach event held at JMU for middle school girls.
During the event, the girls attend multiple STEM workshops organized by JMU faculty and students, as well as listen to presentations by women working in STEM fields.
The event can host up to 250 attendees, 20 workshops, 100+ volunteers, and 50+ organizers, workers, parents and guests.

**madiSTEM Workshop Management** (MWM) supports the planning and organization of madiSTEM workshops.
MWM allows the workshop organizer to oversee the planning of workshops.
Workshop leaders can log into the system to submit details about their workshop, including the title and description that will be posted on the madiSTEM website.
The system tracks the status of each workshop and facilitates scheduling, required materials, and other needs.
